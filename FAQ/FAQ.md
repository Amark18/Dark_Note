  <summary>Budget</summary>
    <details><summary>How to set up budget?</summary>
        Make sure budget is not disabled in settings (the toggle should be off) and set your budget and expense symbols.
    </details>
    <details><summary>How to use?</summary>
        To use, you need to set your budget inside a checklist item (or sublist item) by using your budget symbol and amount. For example, if my budget symbol is "+$", in a checklist item, I just set +$2000. Then I am all set. For expenses, you do the same except you use your expense symol. For example, let's say my budget symbol is $, I just put $100.
    </details>
    <details><summary>Good to know?</summary>
        You can specify your budget or expense anywhere in a checklist or sublist and you can use your notes alongside it. For example, you can put "Mike owes me $20" or "-$20 refund from amazon", it will be understood by the app. Keep in mind, a negative number will subtract from your expenses.
