## Purpose
This app was created because I wanted to modernize the popular note app ColorNote. Although it is a great and useful app, I felt like the user interface took away from the user experience. After having used ColorNote for a couple years, I felt it was time to do it. Using ColorNote and BlackNote as inspiration, I combined the best of both worlds and I created Dark Note. Now I use dark note everyday to keep track of my notes and even my monthly budget.
